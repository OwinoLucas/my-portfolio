        <div class="skills-info">
            <p>In my time at Jomo Kenyatta university, I was fortunate to learn Java which is the language that got
                me interested in programming, after i completed my studies there and moved on to Moringa, I got
                introduced
                to JavaScript and JQuery that was really interesting and i was able to complete a couple of projects
                that are available in my github account.</p><br>
            <p>As i continued with my studies there i got introduced to Python language which is currently my got to
                language. In other words i'm more familiar with Python than any other language i've interacted with. I
                used it to work with frameworks such as Flask and Django and developed projects such as Instagram and
                awwwards clone and personal blogs.</p><br>
            <p>I was also fortunate enough to interact with TypeScript, a superscript of JavaScript which was also
                interesting as it allowed me to learn and use front-end frameworks such as Angular.</p>
